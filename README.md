# Trip Tracker Android Application

## Application
Created for a Fall 2022 Application Development II course. This application allows drivers to add, view, edit and delete trips they made. Each trip added includes the car's odometer at the start and end of the trip, the date and time of the trip, the duration of the trip, and whether the trip was for uber or a personal trip. All inputed trips are displayed on a dashboard and colour coded based on whether they are a personal or uber trip. Each trip can be deleted or edited via a context menu that appears when the user hold-clicks. There is also an option to filter the list of trips by the date, which is selected through a datepicker.

## Technologies
Technologies and concepts utilized in the project are Java, interfaces, object-oriented programming, XML, RecyclerViews, DatePicker and Data Binding. The project includes a repository design pattern.
